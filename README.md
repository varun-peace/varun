## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science Engineering student with a strong interest in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and backend web development.  
I enjoy building real-world applications using modern tech stacks and solving practical problems through code and data.

I believe in staying grounded, being loyal, and building tech that matters. My learning philosophy is simple: Learn by doing and build with purpose.
